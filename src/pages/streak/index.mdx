# Streak - habit tracker for Trello

Streak is a Trello Power-Up that allows you to track habits straight on your Trello board.

![An example of how you could use Streak](./streak.png)

You check off that you've completed your habit using the calendar on the Trello card, and then you can see at a glance how you're tracking across all your habits with the little badges on the front of the cards.

This is my first Trello Power-Up (and first proper side project, too). It's being hosted for free on Github Pages.

You can check it out via [Trello's Power-Ups directory](https://trello.com/power-ups/5c02759abbb4b58f5d5d2526/streak-habit-tracker).

If you have any feedback or feature suggestions for Streak, I'd love to hear from you! You can contact me [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/emma_goto).
